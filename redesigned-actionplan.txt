# WhatsApp Drip Sequence System - Redesigned Action Plan

## PROJECT OVERVIEW
Create a focused WhatsApp drip sequence system for automated nurturing with day-based message scheduling.

## KEY FEATURES
- Multiple drip sequences (e.g., "WhatsApp Marketing 1", "Lead Generation Tool 1")
- Day-based message scheduling (Day 1, Day 3, Day 7, etc.)
- Bulk enrollment (CSV, form, API)
- Smart personalization (name or "there" fallback)
- Manual user control (pause/stop)
